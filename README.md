# SKULLER ðŸ’€ A Loot Survivor Adventurer Renderer

**Loot Survivor** is a fully on-chain arcade dungeon crawler built on Starknet in conjunction with [Realms.world](https://realms.world)
and [BibliothecaDAO](https://www.bibliothecadao.xyz/).

**Skuller** is a custom renderer for the **Adventurer** tokens, based on the original LS 1.5
[renderer](https://github.com/Provable-Games/loot-survivor/blob/main/contracts/game/src/game/renderer.cairo)
and wrapped with [Dojo](https://www.dojoengine.org/) for easy deployment and upgradability.

Adventurers are tokenized games, randomly generated, that you play until you die.
They represent the current state of the game, from inception to death, and include player status, inventory and ranking.
