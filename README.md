# Loot Survivor Adventurer Renderer

**Loot Survivor** is a fully onchain arcade dungeon crawler built on Starknet in conjunction with Realms.world. Explore the dynamically generated dungeons while you fight for your life against beasts and obstacles in pursuit of a spot on the esteemed leaderboard.

This project is a custom renderer for the **Adventurer** tokens, based on the original LS 1.5
[renderer.cairo](https://github.com/Provable-Games/loot-survivor/blob/main/contracts/game/src/game/renderer.cairo)
and wrapped with [Dojo](https://www.dojoengine.org/) for easy deployment and management.
